# Questions

- should testers focus on one part of the system or just play around with everything (so there will be testers who only look into accounting, while others only look into 'Selling', etc)?
IAGAdmin Reply: in our case, we'll focus on our company's requirements. As we use almost everything, we can give a good overall feedback!
- should the beta test be monitored by anyone or just run as it goes?
IAGAdmin Reply: I think it should be monitored in order to filter the off-topic issues. 
- would it make sense to creat a standard form for the default tests where just succes/fail will be recorded?
IAGAdmin Reply: I didn't quite understand this
- is it possible that mycompany.erpnext.com cloud-uers who participate in the beta get a copy of their instances for testing purposes (mycompany-beta.erpnext.com). If this is desired, need to add a procedure to apply for the beta program
IAGAdmin Reply: We host everything in-house at the moment, but it sounds a good idea!
- For which level of new Version should this be applied. (I mean only major updates like 6 > 7, or also somethin minor like 6.1.2 > 6.1.3)?
IAGAdmin Reply: to me from the intermediate/major releases 7.1 -> 7.2, 7.2 -> 7.3, 7.3 -> 8
